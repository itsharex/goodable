## Work Mode (Cowork-style): Local File Workflows

**Work Mode brings Cowork-style workflows to your desktop: Authorize folder → Plan → Execute → Progress report.**

Think of it as: letting AI handle complete workflows of "organizing, extracting, and generating deliverables" within your selected folders.

**4 Built-in Work Skills Templates:**
- ✅ **Local Folder Organization**: Archive by rules, batch rename, generate structured directories
- ✅ **Financial Invoice / Expense Reports**: Extract fields from files/images/text, generate expense reports and summary tables
- ✅ **Contract Organization**: Batch process contracts, extract key terms and clauses, output lists and summaries
- ✅ **HR Resume Processing**: Batch organize resumes, extract candidate information, output structured tables and screening results

We've added commonly used Skills for office scenarios and are continuously expanding the library.

**Download the latest release to try Work Mode now!**

## What is Goodable?

Goodable is an "AI toolbox for everyday people", with the core goal of turning "using AI" into "delivering results".

Think of it as: **A continuously evolving template marketplace + powerful generation/transformation capabilities + one-click deployment** — capable of both AI-powered application delivery and office workflow delivery.

## Positioning & Comparison

Goodable takes the "desktop delivery" route: supporting both code delivery and office workflow delivery.

- **Professional IDE/coding assistants for developers** (Cursor, TRAE, Qoder, Claude Code): Powerful and flexible, but typically require handling development environments, dependencies, and project structures — higher barrier for non-developers.
- **Web-based AI tools** (Coze, Manus, Lovable, Base44, etc.): Strong at "click and get pages", but limited by browser sandboxing — restricted local resource access, deep engineering capabilities, and self-hosting options.
- **Cowork-style workflow tools**: Emphasize "file organization and information extraction within authorized directories". Goodable's **Work Mode** draws inspiration from this paradigm while providing cross-platform desktop capabilities integrated with template delivery and one-click deployment.
- **Goodable (our positioning)**: Out of the box + local desktop + Code / Work dual mode + template delivery + one-click deployment. Lowers the barrier for non-technical users while preserving engineering depth and self-hosting options for advanced users.

## Roadmap

> One direction: turning "ordinary people using AI" from writing code into "continuously delivering applications and results".

* **More one-click deployments**

  * One-click deploy to: WeChat Mini Program / Alipay Mini Program / Douyin Mini Program / Quick App (planned)
  * One-click generate and deploy: Android / iOS apps (planned)

* **Stronger "clone/refactor" capabilities**

  * One-click clone any website (inspired by open-lovable's experience, but more "production engineering" oriented)
  * Upgrade from "clone UI" to "clone product capability + data structure + deployment architecture"

* **Template marketplace upgrade**

  * Support user-published templates (distribution, ratings, versioning, changelogs)
  * Template marketplace reaches **100 production-ready applications** (corresponding to "100agent" initiative: continuously develop/open source 100 agent/application templates)

* **Better non-technical experience**

  * "One-click complete environment/keys/deployment" guided wizard
  * Built-in diagnostics and repair (port conflicts, dependencies, permissions, deployment failure auto-detection)

* **Work Mode enhancements (Cowork-style)**

  * Continuously expand common office Skills (receipts/contracts/HR/material organization/meetings, etc.)
  * Stronger preview and thumbnail views (image/PDF/Office quick preview)
  * Task logs and rollback (avoid accidental operations)
  * Permissions and safety gates (dangerous action confirmations, whitelist policies)
